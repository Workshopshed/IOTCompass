# IOTCompass
A device that always points to where you want to go.

## Overview

A device consisting of an Azure Sphere connected to a serial GPS reciever and stepper motor with a pointer on the motor shaft. As the device is moved it will log its position and calculate what direction a pointer needs to point so that it's always pointing at the same destination.

Where would your pointer point? To your true love? To Home? To a different place depending on the time of day?
